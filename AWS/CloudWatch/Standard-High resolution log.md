> When creating an alarm, select a greater than or equal period to the frequency of the metric to be monitored. For example, basic monitoring for Amazon EC2 provides metrics for your instances every 5 minutes. When setting the alarm on a basic monitoring metric, select a period of at least 300 seconds (5 minutes). Detailed monitoring for Amazon EC2 provides metrics for your instances every 1 minute. When setting the alarm on a detailed monitoring metric, select a period of at least 60 seconds (1 minute).
> If you set the alarm on a high-resolution metric, you can specify a high-resolution alarm with a period of 10 seconds or 30 seconds, or you can set a regular alarm with a period of any multiple of 60 seconds.
