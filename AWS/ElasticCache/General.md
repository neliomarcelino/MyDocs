# General

> ElastiCache is the perfect solution for managing session state. This is also given in the AWS Documentation. In order to address scalability and to provide a shared data storage for sessions that can be accessed from any individual web server, you can abstract the HTTP sessions from the web servers themselves. A common solution to this is to leverage an In-Memory Key/Value store such as Redis and Memcached.
